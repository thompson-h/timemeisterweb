# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the privacy policy for the TimePro iOS app, served as a static website via GitHub Pages. The privacy policy is accessible from within the TimePro app and provides users with information about data collection and usage practices.

## Architecture

The project consists of:
- `index.html`: The main privacy policy page with embedded CSS styling
- Static HTML deployment via GitHub Pages (no build process required)

## Key Information

- **Deployment**: Changes to `index.html` are automatically published to GitHub Pages when committed to the main branch
- **Styling**: Uses inline CSS with Apple-inspired design system fonts and responsive layout
- **Contact**: thompson.costa@gmail.com for questions or concerns
- **Effective Date**: Privacy policy is effective as of 2025-05-31

## Common Tasks

- **Update privacy policy content**: Modify the HTML content within the `.container` div in `index.html`
- **Update effective date**: Change the date in the footer section
- **Deploy changes**: Simply commit changes to the main branch - GitHub Pages handles deployment automatically
